# Fractals Generator

## What about this project ?
The current project is about fractals. I have used P5.js, a free Javascript library that allows to draw on a canvas (HTML element).
I coded several objects containing the instructions to draw the fractals on the canvas using the methods of P5.js.
Fractals that can be generated :

- Pythagorean tree
- Sierpiensky triangle
- fractal tree
- Barnsley fern
- Levy curve
- Dragon's curve
